## Prerequisites

* Java 8 JDK Installed

No instructions are provided for installing and configuring any of the above listed prerequisites.

## Docker Installation

Follow the instructions listed on Docker's website to install the correct version for your platform.

* Linux (Ubuntu, Mint): [Docker CE (recommend convenience script)](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-using-the-convenience-script)
* Windows 10 (Pro, Education, etc): [Docker CE Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
* Windows 7, Windows 10 Home: [Windows Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/)

## Maven Installation

*Required Version*: >3.5.3

Note that IntelliJ generally installs with its own bundled version of Maven. In _some_ cases this is good enough to use and no additional
installation is required. However, occasionally this does cause issues. Our suggestion is to install IntelliJ, follow the configuration
steps below to import the project and see if it builds properly. If it does, skip these instructions.

A primer on Maven is provided at https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html. It goes _deep_ very quickly though.
Thankfully, for the most part it will likely be "set it and forget it".

Detailed installation instructions for maven can be found at the following links:
* (Windows - very detailed) https://www.mkyong.com/maven/how-to-install-maven-in-windows/ 
* (Windows, Mac, Linux) https://www.baeldung.com/install-maven-on-windows-linux-mac

The high level description of installing Maven is:
1. Download the latest version of Maven from http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi (at the time of wrigint that is 3.5.4)
   * Windows: Download the "Binary zip archive" verion (`apache-maven-3.5.4-bin.zip`)
   * Mac / Linux: Download the "Binary tar.gz archive" verion (`apache-maven-3.5.4-bin.tar.gz`)
2. Extract to a directory
3. Set up Maven directories into your system's Path
4. After installation and configuration of IntelliJ, remember to instruct IntelliJ to use the installed version

### Specifying a different Maven version in IntelliJ

If a newer version of Maven is installed than what is bundled with IntelliJ, you need to tell IntelliJ to use that version instead of
IntelliJ's version.

Before following these steps, make sure that the later Maven version is installed and configured then restart IntelliJ. It does a
fairly good job of detecting other Maven installations which simplifies the following steps.

1. File --> Settings...
2. Build, Execution, Deployment --> Buld Tools --> Maven
3. Change the `Maven home directory` dropdown to point to the proper directory
   * You may need to actually browse to the proper location if IntelliJ didn't detect it properly. However, this is usually
   a sign that Maven wasn't fully configured (specifically the M2_HOME was set, etc.).
4. Ensure that the expected Maven Version number is now showing under the `Maven home directory` dropdown. This indicates that
IntelliJ was able to communicate with it properly.
5. Click Apply. Click Ok.

Run a `mvn clean install` and ensure that the build finishes successfully.

## Docker MySQL

For local development, a MySQL Database is necessary. The recommended way to run this is to run it via a Docker Container.
These instructions use the [official MySQL](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql/) image from Docker Hub.

Running MySQL in a Docker Container has several benefits, but the one benefit which is the deciding factor for including
this as the standard is not needing to install and configure MySQL. Simply pulling down a Docker Image that is ready to
go is simpler. (Docker is rapidly becoming an industry standard so gaining experience with it has added benefit beyond
this project itself.)

(Note - A native installation is sufficient if you choose to take that route instead. Follow instructions to apply 
schema & sql scripts from the [Database README.md](/Database/README.md))

1. Pull down the latest Docker MySQL Server:
```sh
>> docker pull mysql:5.7
```
2. Create and start a MySQL container:
```sh
>> docker run --name mysql_shmoozed -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-Secret-pw -p 3306:3306 -d mysql:5.7
```
3. Verify container is running and ready:
```sh
>> docker ps

CONTAINER ID  IMAGE      COMMAND                 CREATED        STATUS       PORTS                    NAMES
0cb56dbb7217  mysql:5.7  "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"  3 seconds ago  Up 2 seconds -p 5801:5801, 33060/tcp  mysql_shmoozed
```
4. MySQL is now running and ready to be connected to
5. Follow instructions to apply schema & sql scripts from the [Database README.md](/Database/README.md) file.

### Useful Docker Commands

* Stop Docker Container: `docker stop mysql_shmoozed`
* Start Docker Container: `docker start mysql_shmoozed`
* Delete Docker Container (must be stopped first): `docker rm mysql_shmoozed`

## IntelliJ IDE Configuration

The following intructions are specific to IntelliJ Ultimate. Any IDE which can import a Maven pom.xml file and generate a project from it 
_should_ be able to import this project and begin working with it. 

IntelliJ Ultimate is necessary as we are using Spring & Spring Boot. See the [comparison chart](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/editions_comparison_matrix.html) between Community Edition & Ultimate Edition for details. IntelliJ offers free Ultimate subscirptions to students.

One common IDE for Spring Development is [Spring Tool Suite](https://spring.io/tools) which is built on Eclipse. If no Ultimate license is 
available, consider using Spring Tool Suite which is free. No detailed instructions are provided, but it is basically just Open --> Existing Maven Project --> Locate `pom.xml` and import project.

### Import Styleguide

To help keep the code clean and unified, a code styleguide for IntelliJ is provided. These instructions explain how to import and use that in IntelliJ.

1. File --> Settings...
2. Editor --> Code Style
3. Click the "gear" icon next to `Scheme` --> Import Scheme --> IntelliJ IDEA code style XML
4. Browse to `/BackEnd/Java_Code_Style.xml`. Click Ok.
5. Check the `Current scheme` checkbox. Click Ok.
6. Ensure that `Java Code Style` is shown in the `Scheme` dropdown

### Open/Import Project

1. File --> Open...
2. Navigate to `/semesterproject-group-2/BackEnd/shmoozed` and click on the `shmoozed` directory
![](intellij-import-1.png)
3. Click Ok
4. IntelliJ and Maven should download all required dependencies. Wait for this to complete.
5. In the Right Side of IntelliJ, expand the `Maven Projects` tab
6. Expand shmoozed --> Lifecycle
7. Ctrl + Click to select both `clean` and `install`
8. Click the green "Run Maven Build" button at the top of the panel.
   * (Behind the scenes this is doing a `mvn clean install` commandline operation)
![](intellij-import-2.png)
9. A teminal window will appear with a bunch of log output
10. Ensure that it ends with a message of `BUILD SUCCESS` with output logs similar to:
    ```

    ```
11. At this point, the project is configured and imported and you are ready to start using and developing the application.

### Run Application

IntelliJ should detect what it needs to in order to Run the application. To run, simply click the green "Run" button next to `ShmoozedApplication`:
![](intellij-run-1.png)

(Note that behind the scenes, IntelliJ is essentially doing a `mvn spring-boot:run` on the commandline.)

You should see log output similar to:
```

```

Once you see the lines `Tomcat started on port(s): 8080 (http)` and `tarted ShmoozedApplication in 2.315 seconds` your application is running and ready to receive requests.

To stop the application, click the "Stop" button in the console window at the bottom of IntelliJ:
![](intellij-stop.png)


If for some reason IntelliJ didn't configure it properly, click the dropdown next to the "Run" button and click Edit Configurations. From there
configure an application which looks like the following screenshot:
![](intellij-run-2.png)
You should only have to configure that once then IntelliJ will remember it. Select your new configuration from the dropdown and click the green
"Run" button.

Additional details about running Spring Boot applications found here: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-boot-running-your-application.html

### Run Unit Tests

Unit tests are run as part of the `install` phase of the normal Maven Clean and Install cycle. However, it is wise to run them fairly often.
The simplest way to do this is to Right-click on a Test file and choose "Run Test...". This will run all tests in that single file. The same thing
can be done by Right-clicking on the entire `test` directory and choose "Run Unittests in driectory". This will run all tests in that directory.

### Manual Testing with Postman

A Collection of [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) calls is located at `/BackEnd/postman/` which can be imported 
into Postman to jumpstart your manual testing of the Back-end API.

As new endpoints are added, these Postman collections should be updated with example calls.
