## Diagramming Software - Draw.io

For architectural and other diagramming, this project uses [Draw.io](https://www.draw.io/).

All diagrams generated in Draw.io should be saved into this repository as **both** an _uncompressed_ **XML** file and a **PNG** file. By saving both versions within the repository it allows the PNG to be linked to within the documenation as well as provides a way for the document to be imported back into Draw.io for future editing.

To Export an Uncompressed XML: File --> Export As --> XML --> Uncheck "Compressed"
To Export a PNG: File --> Export As --> PNG

_(Ideally we'd integrate Draw.io directly into our GitHub repository, but that involves authorizing it
as an external application which probably isn't worth the effort right now.)_

## Markdown

All documenation should use the features of Github's Markdown support:
* https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/
* https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet
